Play the Ms.Pacman game where the objective is to eat as many red squares as possible while avoiding the ghosts, with 3 lives to spare. 

The agent plays the game autonomously using Q-Learning to describe the state action pairs throughout the game. The Q values are trained using a neural network which
takes the states as input and the Q values for each action as output. In this method the Q-net is used to link each state vector to each action.
